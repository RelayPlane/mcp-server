# RelayPlane Code API

Generated by `@relayplane/mcp-server`

## Overview

This directory contains TypeScript types and function stubs for interacting with RelayPlane workflows.
These files are intended for use with MCP-enabled AI assistants.

## Usage

When using an MCP-enabled AI assistant (like Claude with MCP), you can reference these types
in your code. The actual execution happens through MCP tool calls.

```typescript
import { run, workflow } from './servers/relayplane';

// Single model call
const result = await run({
  model: "openai:gpt-4o",
  prompt: "Summarize this document..."
});

// Multi-step workflow
const workflowResult = await workflow({
  name: "extract-and-validate",
  steps: [
    { name: "extract", model: "openai:gpt-4o", prompt: "Extract data..." },
    { name: "validate", model: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", depends: ["extract"], prompt: "Validate..." }
  ],
  input: { document: "..." }
});
```

## Context Efficiency

RelayPlane workflows provide **90%+ context reduction** on multi-step pipelines.
Intermediate results stay in the workflow engine, not your context window.

## Cost

All costs shown are **provider costs** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
RelayPlane is BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) — we don't charge for API usage.
